<h2>Song Lyrics</h2>

        <ul>
        <h3>[Verse 1]<br></h3>
        <p>I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
        I just can't say I don't love you<br>
        'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
        It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
        But tonight, I'm gon' let you know<br>
        Let me tell the truth<br>
        Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Refrain]</br></h3>
				<p>You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
				You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
				You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night<br>
				I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
				I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
				I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
				It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
				And I know that you're worth it<br>
				I can't walk away, (oh)<br>
				
		<h3><br>[Chorus]</br></h3>
		<p class="chorus">Even though we're going through it<br>
		And it makes you feel alone<br>
		Just know that I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
		The distance and the time between us<br>
		It'll never change my mind<br>
		'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Verse 2]</br></h3>
		<p>I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going through<br>
		But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you<br>
		Just don't blame me too, yeah<br>
		'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
		And you won't find no one that's better<br>
		'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
		I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Refrain]</br></h3>
		<p>You know what I'm thinking, see it in your eyes<br>
		You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
		It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
		And I know that you're worth it<br>
		I can't walk away<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Chorus]</br></h3>
		<p class="chorus">Even though we're going through it<br>
		And it makes you feel alone<br>
		Just know that I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeahThe distance and the time between us<br>
		It'll never change my mind<br>
		'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Bridge]</br></h3>
		<p>I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
		Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
		I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
		I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
		Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
		Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
		
		<h3><br>[Chorus]</br></h3>
		<p class="chorus">Even though we're going through it<br>
		And it makes you feel alone<br>
		Just know that I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
		The distance and the time between us<br>
		It'll never change my mind<br>
		'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
		Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
